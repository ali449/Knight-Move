# Knight-Move
An example of the problem of finding the [shortest-path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem) for [knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_(chess)) moves in Java FX.

In this project we have a 20 by 20 chessboard. We have a piece that looks like a horse in chess (L like)
moves. Which must move from point (1) and (1) and reach point (20 and 20).

The project also has the ability to place obstacles anywhere.

The route from the origin to the destination and the nodes met are marked and numbered
Nodes passed to the destination are shown at the bottom of the page.
